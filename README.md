# Theos-Auto-Installer
Should work on iOS 5+ any jailbreak. Please report any bugs you may encounter, but I believe they're all squashed.

Usage: 'tai' will download and install theos & sdks files if it's not already. 'tai -r' will download and re-install theos and all the required sdks files. 'tai -u' will uninstall theos & sdks files. 'tai -s' will download sdks only.
